Physiotherapy plays a significant role in rehabilitation. In the new twenty-first century, where the pandemic has taken a toll on every aspect of our life, the field of physiotherapy has had adverse effects. The area has been threatened by a challenge regarding the level of contact physiotherapists have with patients. There is an urgent need to explore possibilities other than in-person contacts to limit the spread of the virus.
Even before the pandemic, the field of physiotherapy was taking a hit . Patients were often forced to abandon the therapy midway after they failed to see efficient results. On the contrary, physiotherapists were forced to use complicated instruments to ensure the correct way suited for a patient . But in the new normal where in-person contact is discouraged, Is there anything we as engineers could do to solve this issue?

The curated idea to counter this problem was to use a video camera, preferably a webcam or the front camera, to capture the patient's different movements and then approximately calculate the angles between their limbs through AI/ML computer vision (CV) to be precise. As a result, experts would be able to track their patient's movements in real-time.This would help the physiotherapist become more familiar with their patientâ€™s movement and create better results.
