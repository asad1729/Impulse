## Domain  : AI / ML

## Project : IMPULSE

## Theme   : Healthcare

## Overview :
Physiotherapy plays a significant role in rehabilitation. In the new twenty-first century, where the pandemic has taken a toll on every aspect of our life, the field of physiotherapy has had adverse effects. The area has been threatened by a challenge regarding the level of contact physiotherapists have with patients. There is an urgent need to explore possibilities other than in-person contacts to limit the spread of the virus.
Even before the pandemic, the field of physiotherapy was taking a hit . Patients were often forced to abandon the therapy midway after they failed to see efficient results. On the contrary, physiotherapists were forced to use complicated instruments to ensure the correct way suited for a patient . But in the new normal where in-person contact is discouraged, Is there anything we as engineers could do to solve this issue?

The curated idea to counter this problem was to use a video camera, preferably a webcam or the front camera, to capture the patient's different movements and then approximately calculate the angles between their limbs through AI/ML computer vision (CV) to be precise. As a result, experts would be able to track their patient's movements in real-time.This would help the physiotherapist become more familiar with their patient’s movement and create better results.

## Libraries Used : NumPy , MediaPipe, CV2

## Features Used :
● Usability:
1. Health Professionals can use Impulse to monitor and record their patient's movements. This would help them to create suitable exercises for their patients to see better results.

2. Athletes and Sportsperson often go through a period where their play is not up to the mark. They could easily spot the mistakes in their movements and posture using Impulse.

## Scaling aspiration for the project 
The main idea behind the scalability of our project is to make it available to nearly everyone. With the pandemic restricting us within the walls of our houses, our posture and movements have never been worse. With more and more people going into the tech industry, which requires sitting at one place for hours, Impulse can help check their posture. Even in schools, a small session of physical activity can prevent unwanted health issues in the future for the children. We plan to expand it to every tech industry and every school possible. That would be our strategy to scale the project.

## What we plan to acheive in the near future ?
● We aim to make the project more user-friendly. For this, we would try implementing a better and more user-friendly UI/UX interface.

● We plan to make small snippets of yoga and training sessions to give users something to refer to.

● Impulse would generate a detailed report of a session or a day in the future showing when and where the users were comprising their exercises or posture.
